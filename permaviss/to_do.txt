DONE:
- Compute horizontal differentials of spectral sequence.
- Implement spectral_sequence.add_higher_output function

TO DO:
- Check deg and n_dim space for self.Hom and self.Im in spectral sequence class
- Take into account what happens when domain/range is zero,
	this info is enclosed in MV_ss.page_dim_matrix
- Check PH_classic, with trivial cases in mind. 
	This should be adapted so that all rows have some content, even if it is empty. 

This should finish the computation to infinity page, hooray!

- spectral_sequence.extension
- persistence_algebra.repair_barcode

Then, run the code and debug it. It will be infested. 
Finally, once it works, produce nice pictures, with Images for Research in mind. 

Additionally, could it be possible to implement mapper diagrams?
Something like coloured bars and coloured mappers
